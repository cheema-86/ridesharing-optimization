- Dataset
    - Get dataset from kaggle
    - Use prediction model to analyze the dataset to find hotspots
    - Get information for possible preplanned routes

- Simulation
    - Using Godot Engine
    - Create a top down city map
    - Simulate customer pickup and dropoff
    - Use ml model to decide pickup and dropoff

- ML Model
    - Use Python to analyze the dataset and simulation to create ml model
    - The model decides where the vehicle will go next for pickup/dropoff
    - The model will be responsible for determining the most efficient pickup/drop pattern to satisfy all constraints (minimizing wait time, minimize detour)
