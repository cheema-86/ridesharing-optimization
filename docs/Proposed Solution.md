The problem of optimizing a ride sharing platform for optimal performance is one of great importance to save customers' money, reduce drivers' fuel usage as well as reduce congestion in the city by reducing the number of vehicles on the road. To create a solution that is optimal for all parties we also need to keep in mind the convineance part of the problem. A good ridesharing platform must reduce both customer and driver costs to incentivise them to use it, but should also minimize the customer waiting times and detours to keep up the quality of service. To come up with such a solution this research article aims to use the help of Artificial Intellegence and Machine Learning to create the optimized algorithm for the task. To train the data we shall create a simulated city with customers appearing along with randomized pick and drop location, as getting internal data from a ridesharing platform provider would prove difficult our best bet is to use traffic data from Google Maps to get an idea of hotspots and traffic patterns to create an accurate simulation to train our algorithm on. The algorithm can be used by ridesharing platforms to improve their services within metropolitan cities at first, and can later be expanded to more locations, although the algorithm is intended to be one-size fits all however different locations have different properties and training on location specific data would yeild much better results.
